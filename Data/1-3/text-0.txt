The x87 FPU (beginning with the P6 family processors) supports two mechanisms for branching and performing conditional moves according to comparisons of two floating-point values. These mechanism are referred to here as the “old mechanism” and the “new mechanism.”

The old mechanism is available in x87 FPU’s prior to the P6 family processors and in P6 family processors. This mechanism uses the floating-point compare instructions (FCOM, FCOMP, FCOMPP, FTST, FUCOMPP, FICOM, and FICOMP) to compare two floating-point values and set the condition code flags (C0 through C3) according to the results. The contents of the condition code flags are then copied into the status flags of the EFLAGS register using a two step process (see Figure 8-5):

1. The FSTSW AX instruction moves the x87 FPU status word into the AX register.
2. The SAHF instruction copies the upper 8 bits of the AX register, which includes the condition code flags, into the lower 8 bits of the EFLAGS register.

When the condition code flags have been loaded into the EFLAGS register, conditional jumps or conditional moves can be performed based on the new settings of the status flags in the EFLAGS register.
