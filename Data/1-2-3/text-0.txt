The six x87 FPU floating-point exception flags (bits 0 through 5) of the x87 FPU status word indicate that one or more floating-point exceptions have been detected since the bits were last cleared. The individual exception flags (IE, DE, ZE, OE, UE, and PE) are described in detail in Section 8.4., “x87 FPU Floating-Point Exception Handling”. Each of the exception flags can be masked by an exception mask bit in the x87 FPU control word (see Section 8.1.4., “x87 FPU Control Word”). The exception summary status flag (ES, bit 7) is set when any of the unmasked exception flags are set. When the ES flag is set, the x87 FPU exception handler is invoked, using one of the techniques described in Section 8.7., “Handling x87 FPU Exceptions in Software”. (Note that if an exception flag is masked, the x87 FPU will still set the appropriate flag if the associated exception occurs, but it will not set the ES flag.)

The exception flags are “sticky” bits (once set, they remain set until explicitly cleared). They can be cleared by executing the FCLEX/FNCLEX (clear exceptions) instructions, by reinitializing the x87 FPU with the FINIT/FNINIT or FSAVE/FNSAVE instructions, or by overwriting the flags with an FRSTOR or FLDENV instruction.

The B-bit (bit 15) is included for 8087 compatibility only. It reflects the contents of the ES flag.
