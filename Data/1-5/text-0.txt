The infinity control flag (bit 12 of the x87 FPU control word) is provided for compatibility with the Intel 287 Math Coprocessor; it is not meaningful for later version x87 FPU coprocessors or IA-32 processors. See Section 4.8.3.3., “Signed Infinities”, for information on how the x87 FPUs handle infinity values.
