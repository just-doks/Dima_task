The 16-bit x87 FPU status register (see Figure 8-4) indicates the current state of the x87 FPU. The flags in the x87 FPU status register include the FPU busy flag, top-of-stack (TOP) pointer, condition code flags, error summary status flag, stack fault flag, and exception flags. The x87 FPU sets the flags in this register to show the results of operations.
