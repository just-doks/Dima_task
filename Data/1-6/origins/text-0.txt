The 16-bit tag word (see Figure 8-7) indicates the contents of each the 8 registers in the x87 FPU data-register stack (one 2-bit tag per register). The tag codes indicate whether a register contains a valid number, zero, or a special floating-point number (NaN, infinity, denormal, or unsupported format), or whether it is empty. The x87 FPU tag word is cached in the x87 FPU in the x87 FPU tag word register. When the x87 FPU is initialized with either an FINIT/FNINIT or FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction, the x87 FPU tag word is set to FFFFH, which marks all the x87 FPU data registers as empty.
