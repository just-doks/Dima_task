The 16-bit x87 FPU control word (see Figure 8-6) controls the precision of the x87 FPU and rounding method used. It also contains the x87 FPU floating-point exception mask bits. The control word is cached in the x87 FPU control register. The contents of this register can be loaded with the FLDCW instruction and stored in memory with the FSTCW/FNSTCW instructions.
