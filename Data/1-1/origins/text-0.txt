The x87 FPU data registers (shown in Figure 8-1) consist of eight 80-bit registers. Values are stored in these registers in the double extended-precision floating-point format shown in Figure 4-3. When floating-point, integer, or packed BCD integer values are loaded from memory into any of the x87 FPU data registers, the values are automatically converted into double extendedprecision floating-point format (if they are not already in that format). When computation results are subsequently transferred back into memory from any of the x87 FPU registers, the results can be left in the double extended-precision floating-point format or converted back into a shorter floating-point format, an integer format, or the packed BCD integer format. (See Section 8.2., “x87 FPU Data Types” for a description of the data types operated on by the x87 FPU.)
