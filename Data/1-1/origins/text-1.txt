The x87 FPU instructions treat the eight x87 FPU data registers as a register stack (see Figure 8-2). All addressing of the data registers is relative to the register on the top of the stack. The register number of the current top-of-stack register is stored in the TOP (stack TOP) field in the x87 FPU status word. Load operations decrement TOP by one and load a value into the new topof-stack register, and store operations store the value from the current TOP register in memory and then increment TOP by one. (For the x87 FPU, a load operation is equivalent to a push and a store operation is equivalent to a pop.) Note that load and store operations are also available that do not push and pop the stack.
