The stack fault flag (bit 6 of the x87 FPU status word) indicates that stack overflow or stack underflow has occurred with data in the x87 FPU data register stack. The x87 FPU explicitly sets the SF flag when it detects a stack overflow or underflow condition, but it does not explicitly clear the flag when it detects an invalid-arithmetic-operand condition. 
When this flag is set, the condition code flag C1 indicates the nature of the fault: overflow (C1 = 1) and underflow (C1 = 0). The SF flag is a “sticky” flag, meaning that after it is set, the processor does not clear it until it is explicitly instructed to do so (for example, by an FINIT/FNINIT, FCLEX/FNCLEX, or FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction).
See Section 8.1.6., “x87 FPU Tag Word” for more information on x87 FPU stack faults.
