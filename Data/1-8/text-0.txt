The x87 FPU stores the opcode of the last non-control instruction executed in an 11-bit x87 FPU opcode register. (This information provides state information for exception handlers.) Only the first and second opcode bytes (after all prefixes) are stored in the x87 FPU opcode register. Figure 8-8 shows the encoding of these two bytes. Since the upper 5 bits of the first opcode byte are the same for all floating-point opcodes (11011B), only the lower 3 bits of this byte are stored in the opcode register.
