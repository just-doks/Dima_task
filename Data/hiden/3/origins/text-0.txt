The floating-point instructions that the x87 FPU supports can be grouped into six functional categories:
• Data transfer instructions
• Basic arithmetic instructions
• Comparison instructions
• Transcendental instructions
• Load constant instructions
• x87 FPU control instructions

See Section 5.2., “x87 FPU Instructions”, for a list of the floating-point instructions by category.
The following section briefly describes the instructions in each category. Detailed descriptions of the floating-point instructions are given in Chapter 3, Instruction Set Reference A-M and Chapter 4, Instruction Set Reference N-Z of the IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volumes 2A & 2B.
