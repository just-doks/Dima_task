The following instructions provide two different logarithmic functions, an exponential function, and a scale function.
FYL2X 		Logarithm
FYL2XP1 	Logarithm epsilon
F2XM1		Exponential
FSCALE 		Scale

The FYL2X and FYL2XP1 instructions perform two different base 2 logarithmic operations.
The FYL2X instruction computes (y * log2 x). This operation permits the calculation of the log of any base using the following equation:

logb x = (1/log2 b) * log2 x

The FYL2XP1 instruction computes (y * log2(x + 1)). This operation provides optimum accuracy for values of x that are close to 0.

The F2XM1 instruction computes (2^x - 1). This instruction only operates on source values in the range -1.0 to +1.0.
The FSCALE instruction multiplies the source operand by a power of 2.
