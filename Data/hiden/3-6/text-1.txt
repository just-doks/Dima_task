The FICOM and FICOMP instructions also operate the same as the FCOM and FCOMP instructions, except that the source operand is an integer value in memory. The integer value is automatically converted into an double extended-precision floating-point value prior to making the comparison. The FICOMP instruction pops the x87 FPU register stack following the comparison operation.

The FTST instruction performs the same operation as the FCOM instruction, except that the value in register ST(0) is always compared with the value 0.0.

The FCOMI and FCOMIP instructions were introduced into the IA-32 architecture in the P6 family processors. They perform the same comparison as the FCOM and FCOMP instructions, except that they set the status flags (ZF, PF, and CF) in the EFLAGS register to indicate the results of the comparison (see Table 8-7) instead of the x87 FPU condition code flags. The FCOMI and FCOMIP instructions allow condition branch instructions (Jcc) to be executed directly from the results of their comparison.
