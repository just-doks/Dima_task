The double extended-precision floating-point format permits many encodings that do not fall into any of the categories shown in Table 4-3. Table 8-3 shows these unsupported encodings. Some of these encodings were supported by the Intel 287 math coprocessor; however, most of them are not supported by the Intel 387 math coprocessor and later IA-32 processors. These encodings are no longer supported due to changes made in the final version of IEEE Standard 754 that eliminated these encodings.

Specifically, the categories of encodings formerly known as pseudo-NaNs, pseudo-infinities, and un-normal numbers are not supported and should not be used as operand values. The Intel 387 math coprocessor and later IA-32 processors generate an invalid-operation exception when these encodings are encountered as operands.

Beginning with the Intel 387 math coprocessor, the encodings formerly known as pseudodenormal numbers are not generated by IA-32 processors. When encountered as operands, however, they are handled correctly; that is, they are treated as denormals and a denormal exception is generated. Pseudo-denormal numbers should not be used as operand values. They are supported by current IA-32 processors (as described here) to support legacy code.
