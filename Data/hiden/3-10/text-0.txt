New transcendental instruction algorithms were incorporated into the IA-32 architecture beginning with the Pentium processors. These new algorithms (used in transcendental instructions FSIN, FCOS, FSINCOS, FPTAN, FPATAN, F2XM1, FYL2X, and FYL2XP1) allow a higher level of accuracy than was possible in earlier IA-32 processors and x87 math coprocessors. The accuracy of these instructions is measured in terms of units in the last place (ulp). For a given
argument x, let f(x) and F(x) be the correct and computed (approximate) function values, respectively. The error in ulps is defined to be:

error = |(f(x)- F(x))/2^(k - 63)|

where k is an integer such that 1 <= 2^-k f(x) < 2.

With the Pentium processor and later IA-32 processors, the worst case error on transcendental functions is less than 1 ulp when rounding to the nearest (even) and less than 1.5 ulps when rounding in other modes. The functions are guaranteed to be monotonic, with respect to the input operands, throughout the domain supported by the instruction.

The instructions FYL2X and FYL2XP1 are two operand instructions and are guaranteed to be within 1 ulp only when y equals 1. When y is not equal to 1, the maximum ulp error is always within 1.35 ulps in round to nearest mode. (For the two operand functions, monotonicity was proved by holding one of the operands constant.)
