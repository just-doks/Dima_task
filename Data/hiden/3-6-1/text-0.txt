The processor does not offer any control-flow instructions that branch on the setting of the condition code flags (C0, C2, and C3) in the x87 FPU status word. To branch on the state of these flags, the x87 FPU status word must first be moved to the AX register in the integer unit. The FSTSW AX (store status word) instruction can be used for this purpose. When these flags are in the AX register, the TEST instruction can be used to control conditional branching as follows:

1. Check for an unordered result. Use the TEST instruction to compare the contents of the AX register with the constant 0400H (see Table 8-8). This operation will clear the ZF flag in the EFLAGS register if the condition code flags indicate an unordered result; otherwise, the ZF flag will be set. The JNZ instruction can then be used to transfer control (if necessary) to a procedure for handling unordered operands.
