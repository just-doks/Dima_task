2. Check ordered comparison result. Use the constants given in Table 8-8 in the TEST instruction to test for a less than, equal to, or greater than result, then use the corresponding conditional branch instruction to transfer program control to the appropriate procedure or section of code.

If a program or procedure has been thoroughly tested and it incorporates periodic checks for QNaN results, then it is not necessary to check for the unordered result every time a comparison is made.

See Section 8.1.3., “Branching and Conditional Moves on Condition Codes”, for another technique for branching on x87 FPU condition codes.

Some non-comparison x87 FPU instructions update the condition code flags in the x87 FPU status word. To ensure that the status word is not altered inadvertently, store it immediately following a comparison operation.
