The Intel 8087 instructions FENI and FDISI and the Intel 287 math coprocessor instruction FSETPM perform no function in the Intel 387 math coprocessor and later IA-32 processors. If these opcodes are detected in the instruction stream, the x87 FPU performs no specific operation and no internal x87 FPU states are affected.
