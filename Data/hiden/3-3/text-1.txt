The FST (store floating point) and FIST (store integer) instructions store the value in register ST(0) in memory in the destination format (floating point or integer, respectively). Again, the format conversion is carried out automatically.

The FSTP (store floating point and pop), FISTP (store integer and pop), and FBSTP (store packed decimal and pop) instructions store the value in the ST(0) registers into memory in the destination format (floating point, integer, or packed BCD), then performs a pop operation on the register stack. A pop operation causes the ST(0) register to be marked empty and the stack pointer (TOP) in the x87 FPU control work to be incremented by 1. The FSTP instruction can also be used to copy the value in the ST(0) register to another x87 FPU register [ST(i)].

The FXCH (exchange register contents) instruction exchanges the value in a selected register in the stack [ST(i)] with the value in ST(0).

The FCMOVcc (conditional move) instructions move the value in a selected register in the stack [ST(i)] to register ST(0) if a condition specified with a condition code (cc) is satisfied (see Table 8-5). The condition being tested for is represented by the status flags in the EFLAGS register. The condition code mnemonics are appended to the letters “FCMOV” to form the mnemonic for a FCMOVcc instruction.
