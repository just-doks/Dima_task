The precision-control (PC) field (bits 8 and 9 of the x87 FPU control word) determines the precision (64, 53, or 24 bits) of floating-point calculations made by the x87 FPU (see Table 8-2). The default precision is double extended precision, which uses the full 64-bit significand available with the double extended-precision floating-point format of the x87 FPU data registers. This setting is best suited for most applications, because it allows applications to take full advantage of the maximum precision available with the x87 FPU data registers.
