The double precision and single precision settings reduce the size of the significand to 53 bits and 24 bits, respectively. These settings are provided to support IEEE Standard 754 and to provide compatibility with the specifications of certain existing programming languages. Using these settings nullifies the advantages of the double extended-precision floating-point format's 64-bit significand length. When reduced precision is specified, the rounding of the significand value clears the unused bits on the right to zeros.

The precision-control bits only affect the results of the following floating-point instructions:
FADD, FADDP, FIADD, FSUB, FSUBP, FISUB, FSUBR, FSUBRP, FISUBR, FMUL, FMULP, FIMUL, FDIV, FDIVP, FIDIV, FDIVR, FDIVRP, FIDIVR, and FSQRT.
